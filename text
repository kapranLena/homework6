Clickatell is bulk SMS gateway enables businesses to connect, interact and transact with their customers, anywhere in the world. Via our secure bulk SMS messaging platform, we also offer two-way messaging in Sweden using SMS short codes. These are short, easy-to-remember numbers that are ideal for marketing campaigns, CRM messages, lead generation, and improved customer support.
If you do not need a memorable short code, two-way messaging is also available using long numbers which are perfect for transactional messages like PINs and time-critical alerts and notifications.
